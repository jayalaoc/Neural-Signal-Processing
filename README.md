# Neural-Signal-Processing

COGS 118C. Neural Signal Processing (4)

This course will cover theoretical foundations and practical applications of signal processing to neural data. Topics include EEG/field potential methods (filtering, Fourier (spectral) analysis, coherence) and spike train analysis (reverse correlation, spike sorting, multielectrode recordings). Some applications to neural imaging (optical microscopy, fMRI) data will also be discussed.

Topics Covered:

1. Signal and Noise in the Time Domain
2. Signals in the Frequency domain
3. Linear Signal Transformations
4. Filtering
5. Time-Frequency and Phase-based Analysis
6. Spatial Analysis of Multi-Channel Data
7. Spike Trains from Single Neurons
8. Spike Trains From Neural Populations
9. High-Dimensional Data and Imaging
10. Model-Based Analyses
